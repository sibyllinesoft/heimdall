## 🛠 Pre-Migration Setup

### 1. Install Go (Required)

Run the provided installation script:

```bash
# Make script executable (if not already)
chmod +x install-go.sh

# Install Go and development tools
./install-go.sh

# Verify installation
source ~/.bashrc
go version
```

### 2. Validate Go Implementation

Run comprehensive validation:

```bash
# Execute validation suite
./validate.sh

# Review results
cat validation_report.md
```

### 3. Performance Benchmarking

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./... > benchmark_results.log

# Compare with TypeScript baseline
go test -run=BenchmarkCompleteSystem -v ./...
```

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation (Day 1)

1. **Backup Current State**
   ```bash
   # Create backup branch
   git checkout -b backup-typescript-implementation
   git push origin backup-typescript-implementation
   
   # Document current performance baseline
   # Run existing TypeScript tests and capture metrics
   ```

2. **Validate Go Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Run complete test suite
   go test -race -v ./...
   
   # Verify all 301+ tests pass
   # Confirm zero race conditions
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Set up Go module
   go mod tidy
   
   # Install development tools
   go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
   go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
   ```

### Phase 2: Side-by-Side Testing (Day 2-3)

1. **Deploy Go Implementation to Staging**
   ```bash
   # Build Go binary
   go build -o heimdall-go ./cmd/heimdall
   
   # Deploy alongside TypeScript version
   # Configure load balancer for A/B testing
   ```

2. **Run Parallel Tests**
   ```bash
   # Execute load tests on both versions
   # Compare performance metrics
   # Validate identical responses
   ```

3. **Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test with Bifrost router integration
   # Validate all plugin interfaces work correctly
   # Confirm configuration compatibility
   ```

### Phase 3: Production Migration (Day 4)

1. **Gradual Traffic Migration**
   ```bash
   # Route 10% of traffic to Go implementation
   # Monitor performance and error rates
   # Gradually increase to 100% over 4-6 hours
   ```

2. **Monitoring and Validation**
   ```bash
   # Monitor key metrics:
   # - Response time improvements
   # - Error rate reduction
   # - Memory usage decrease
   # - CPU utilization improvement
   ```

3. **TypeScript Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # After 48 hours of stable Go operation:
   # Remove TypeScript files
   # Update documentation
   # Clean up dependencies
   ```

### Phase 4: Optimization (Day 5+)

1. **Performance Tuning**
   ```bash
   # Fine-tune Go implementation based on production metrics
   # Optimize for specific traffic patterns
   # Configure garbage collection parameters
   ```

2. **Documentation Updates**
   ```bash
   # Update all documentation to reflect Go implementation
   # Create operational runbooks
   # Document new performance characteristics
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables

No changes required - Go implementation uses identical environment variables:

```bash
# All existing environment variables work as-is
HEIMDALL_LOG_LEVEL=info
HEIMDALL_PLUGIN_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json
HEIMDALL_METRICS_ENABLED=true
# ... etc
```

### Configuration Files

Go implementation maintains 100% compatibility with existing JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "heimdall-plugin",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "runtime": "go",
  "routes": [ /* existing routes work unchanged */ ],
  "transformations": [ /* existing transforms work unchanged */ ],
  "middleware": [ /* existing middleware work unchanged */ ]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run complete Go test suite
go test -race -v -count=3 ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...

# Run with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (If Issues Arise)

1. **Quick Rollback**
   ```bash
