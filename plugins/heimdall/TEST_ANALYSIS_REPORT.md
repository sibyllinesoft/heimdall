**Estimated additional tests**: ~50-70 tests

## Priority Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Authentication System** - Required for multi-provider support
   - Implement `AuthAdapterRegistry` with registration/retrieval
   - Create OAuth and API key adapters
   - Add header parsing for single/array values
   - Port all auth tests (~60 tests)

2. **Router Execution Engine** - Core routing functionality
   - Implement complete `RouterExecutor` with provider registry
   - Add fallback logic for errors and rate limits
   - Implement credential management
   - Port execution tests (~100 tests)

### Phase 2: Advanced Algorithms (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
3. **Alpha Scoring System** - Model selection optimization
   - Implement α-score algorithm for quality vs cost
   - Add model-specific penalties and bonuses
   - Create exploration vs exploitation logic
   - Port scoring tests (~80 tests)

### Phase 3: Machine Learning Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
4. **GBDT Runtime** - Predictive model integration
   - Implement GBDT model loading and prediction
   - Add feature vector conversion
   - Create fallback probability calculations
   - Port GBDT tests (~90 tests)

### Phase 4: Additional Systems (LOW PRIORITY)
5. **Remaining Components**
   - Catalog client
   - Error handling
   - Configuration management
   - Milestone integration tests

## Implementation Challenges

### Go-Specific Considerations
- **Generics**: Use Go 1.18+ generics for type-safe interfaces
- **Concurrency**: Leverage goroutines for parallel provider calls
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error wrapping and context
- **Testing**: Use testify for mock generation and assertions
- **JSON**: Proper marshaling/unmarshaling for complex data structures

### Architecture Decisions
- **Interface Design**: Create clean interfaces for adapters and providers
- **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for testability
- **Configuration**: Support both environment variables and config files
- **Logging**: Structured logging with different levels
- **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible metrics collection

## Validation Strategy

### Test Porting Process
1. **Direct Translation**: Port TypeScript test logic to Go
2. **Behavior Verification**: Ensure identical behavior across implementations
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare execution speed and memory usage
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end request processing
5. **Load Testing**: Concurrent request handling

### Success Metrics
- [ ] **260+ tests passing** (matching TypeScript coverage)
- [ ] **<10ms average latency** for request processing
- [ ] **99.9% success rate** under normal load
- [ ] **Zero memory leaks** during extended operation
- [ ] **Proper error propagation** with context preservation

## Conclusion

The Go implementation requires significant development to match the TypeScript functionality. The **260+ test gap** represents critical missing features including:

- Complete authentication system
- Advanced router execution with fallbacks
- Sophisticated model selection algorithms  
- Machine learning integration
- Comprehensive error handling

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) to establish foundation, then incrementally add advanced features while maintaining test parity throughout the process.
