## 🌉 The Bifrost Bridge - API Gateway

### 📋 Catalog Service (The Watchtower)

- `GET /v1/models` - Survey all available models across realms
- `GET /v1/capabilities/:model` - Inspect a model's powers and limits  
- `GET /v1/pricing/:model` - Check the toll for each model's service
- `GET /v1/feature-flags` - View active experimental powers

### ⚡ Routing Magic - Integrate with Your Application

Heimdall acts as an intelligent pre-hook, making routing decisions before your requests reach their destination:

```typescript
import { RouterPreHook } from './router/plugins/heimdall/router_prehook.js';

// Summon the guardian
const heimdall = new RouterPreHook(config, catalogBaseUrl);

// Let Heimdall choose the optimal path
const decision = await heimdall.decide({
  url: '/v1/chat/completions',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/json',
    'authorization': 'Bearer user-oauth-token' // Claude OAuth magic ✨
  },
  body: {
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a Python function' }],
    model: 'auto' // Trust Heimdall's judgment
  }
});

// 🎯 Heimdall's decision contains everything you need:
// ⚡ kind: 'anthropic' | 'openai' | 'google' | 'openrouter'  
// 🎯 model: The chosen champion (e.g., 'gpt-5', 'gemini-2.5-pro')
// 🧠 params: Thinking budgets and reasoning effort
// 🔐 auth: Authentication method and credentials
// 🔄 fallbacks: Backup options if the primary fails
```

## 🔮 The All-Seeing Algorithm - How Heimdall Chooses

Like the guardian's nine senses, Heimdall processes every request through multiple layers of intelligence:

### 1. **👁️ Mystical Perception** (⚡ ≤25ms)
   - **Memory Extraction**: Semantic embeddings of your prompt (cached for speed)
   - **Pattern Recognition**: ANN cluster search identifies similar successful routes
   - **Code Sight**: Automatic detection of programming, math, and reasoning tasks
   - **Context Awareness**: Request size and complexity analysis

### 2. **🧠 Machine Learning Triage** 
   - **GBDT Oracle**: Gradient-boosted decision trees predict optimal cost tier
   - **Contextual Guardrails**: Smart overrides for edge cases (ultra-long context → Gemini)
   - **Three-Realm Classification**: Route to cheap/balanced/premium tier

### 3. **⚔️ Champion Selection Within Each Realm**
   - **🏆 Budget Champions**: DeepSeek R1, Qwen3-Coder via OpenRouter
   - **⚖️ Balanced Warriors**: Claude (with OAuth), GPT-5/Gemini (medium reasoning)  
   - **🌟 Premium Titans**: GPT-5/Gemini (high reasoning), Gemini for 200k+ tokens

### 4. **📊 The α-Score Formula** - *Heimdall's Secret Weapon*
   ```
   score = α × Quality[model,cluster] - (1-α) × Cost[model] - penalties
   ```
   *Where α is your quality vs cost preference (0.6 = 60% quality focus)*

## 🏰 The Model Kingdoms - Heimdall's Army

### 🏆 Budget Realm (via OpenRouter)
**Perfect for everyday tasks, maximum value**
- **DeepSeek R1**: Master of reasoning at ~$0.40/1M tokens - *your cost-conscious champion*
- **Qwen3-Coder**: Code specialist with competitive pricing - *the efficient developer's friend*

### ⚖️ Balanced & Premium Realms (Direct APIs)  
**When quality matters, Heimdall deploys the titans**
- **GPT-5**: Controllable reasoning with `low/medium/high` effort settings - *the versatile powerhouse*
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 1M token context mastery with thinking budgets - *the long-context king*

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Heimdall automatically escalates to premium models for complex reasoning, code generation, and ultra-long contexts. You get the right tool for every job, automatically.

## 🔐 Guardian's Keychain - Universal Authentication

Heimdall speaks every authentication language fluently:

### 🎭 **Claude OAuth** (`anthropic-oauth`)
*The seamless integration*
- ✨ **Auto-Detection**: Recognizes Claude Code Bearer tokens instantly
- 🚀 **Direct Passthrough**: Zero-latency routing to Anthropic's API
- 🔄 **Smart Fallback**: Hit a 429 rate limit? Heimdall instantly reroutes to GPT-5/Gemini

### 🌟 **Gemini OAuth/API Key** (`google-oauth`)  
*Maximum flexibility*
- 🔒 **PKCE OAuth Flow**: Enterprise-grade security with Bearer tokens
- 🔑 **API Key Fallback**: Seamless degradation to `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- 📡 **Multi-Channel**: Headers, query parameters - Heimdall handles them all

### ⚡ **OpenAI API Key** (`openai-key`)
*Simple and reliable*
- 🏠 **Environment Variables**: Clean `OPENAI_API_KEY` management
- 👤 **User Keys**: Optional user-provided key support
- 🎯 **Direct Access**: Key-based authentication (no OAuth complexity)

### 🎛️ Authentication Control

Choose your authentication powers in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
auth_adapters:
  enabled: ["anthropic-oauth", "google-oauth", "openai-key"]
  # Mix and match based on your needs - Heimdall adapts
```

## 🛡️ Battle-Tested Resilience

Heimdall never lets you down - every failure becomes an opportunity:

| ⚠️ **Challenge** | ⚡ **Heimdall's Response** |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Claude 429** | *Lightning reroute* → GPT-5 or Gemini (no delay, no failure) |
| **OpenAI/Gemini 5xx** | *Smart cross-fallback* → Alternative model in same quality tier |
| **OpenRouter down** | *Automatic escalation* → Cheap tier → Mid tier (better than nothing) |
| **Context overflow** | *Intelligent upgrade* → Force premium models (Gemini for 200k+ tokens) |

> 🔥 **Result**: 99.9% uptime even when individual providers fail
