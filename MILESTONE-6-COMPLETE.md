## 🎛️ SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Milestone 5 + 6 Unified Architecture
The implementation creates a seamless integration between observability (Milestone 5) and optimization (Milestone 6):

```typescript
Milestone6System {
  // Milestone 5: Real-time Observability
  ├── ObservabilityManager
  │   ├── EnhancedPostHook (metrics collection)
  │   ├── DashboardServer (real-time visualization)  
  │   ├── MetricsCollector (SLO compliance)
  │   └── SLOGuardrails (deployment validation)
  
  // Milestone 6: Continuous Optimization  
  └── ContinuousOptimizer
      ├── CatalogRefresher (nightly updates)
      ├── TuningPipeline (weekly retraining)
      ├── CanaryRolloutSystem (progressive deployment)
      └── RecommendationEngine (optimization suggestions)
}
```

### Data Flow Integration
1. **PostHook** → logs metrics to warehouse
2. **TuningPipeline** → consumes metrics for retraining
3. **CatalogRefresher** → updates model capabilities
